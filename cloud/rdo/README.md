# Rich Data Objects - AWS Lambda Function Code

This sub-directory within the Mobile Observation Ad Toolkit is responsible for holding Amazon Web Services executable Lambda function code, to be loaded into a Python runtime.

The Lambda function code constructs rich data objects, which represent the formalized data donations submitted by participants, and enriched by CLIP classifications and 'Commercial Content Library' data.
