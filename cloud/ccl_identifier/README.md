# Commercial Content Library "Identifier" - AWS Lambda Function Code

This sub-directory within the Mobile Observation Ad Toolkit is responsible for holding Amazon Web Services executable Lambda function code, to be loaded into a Python runtime.

The Lambda function code corresponds to the 'Commercial Content Library' Identifier, which is responsible for extracting an advertiser name from OCR data of an observed advertisement online - this serves the purpose of interpreting and enriching an advertisement with relevant data from a Commercial Content Library.
