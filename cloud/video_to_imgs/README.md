# Video to Images - AWS Lambda Function Code

This sub-directory within the Mobile Observation Ad Toolkit is responsible for holding Amazon Web Services executable Lambda function code, to be loaded into a Python runtime.

The Lambda function code accepts videos downloaded through CCL enrichment, and samples still images therein that can be later evaluated as part of advertisement data.
